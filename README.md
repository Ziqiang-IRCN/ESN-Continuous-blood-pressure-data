# ESN-Continuous-blood-pressure-data
The source codes for the paper ["An ESN-based Method for Identity Recognition with Continuous Blood Pressure Data"](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-44216-2_2).

## Preparation
1. Create an empty file named "data" in the file "CBP-demonstration".  
2. Download the zip file listed in [https://physionet.org/content/autonomic-aging-cardiovascular/1.0.0/] and unzip it into the "data" file.  

## Run
Run the Python file "Run_BiESN.py" to calculate the recognition results of the proposed model in the paper.  
Run the Python file "Run_ESN.py" to calculate the recognition results of the standard ESN.
